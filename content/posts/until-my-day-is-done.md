> Until my day is done

<!--more--> 

Those above sentences currently sit nicely next to my laptop to reminds me everyday:

* that life is too short to regrets things you've done wrong in the past.
* you need to recharge your life motivation every morning.
* do not depends and put hopes to anyone except God that I trust to.
